## Build

Run `ng build-client-dev` to build a version of the `base-app` that contains
 `.map.js` files that allow direct debugging of `typescript` inside a
browser debugger.

Run `ng build-client-prod` to build an optimized version without the `.map` files
that's intended for distribution.

The build artifacts are stored in the `dist/` directory.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` to develop using a dev web server.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

Note that this mode of development isn't currently being used on a regular basis by the developers
and may be broken between revisions.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
