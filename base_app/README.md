# Base_app

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md)
[Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/)

## Build

Run `ng build-client-dev` to build a version of the `base-app` that contains
 `.map.js` files that allow direct debugging of `typescript` inside a
browser debugger.

Run `ng build-client-prod` to build an optimized version without the `.map` files
that's intended for distribution.

The build artifacts are stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
