# Unit Tests

## When to Execute
ALWAYS EXECUTE THE UNIT TESTS AFTER THESE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES:

    a. After updatingany file in the src/public/nodejs folder
    b. When updating src/public/php/xml-diff-tool.php.

1. From the "npm" Tool Window, double-click "test-nodejs-javascript",
   or from the command line in the simpleui folder, execute the command below:

           bash src/test/normalizeJSON.unit-test.bash

2. In the "Run" window, look at the "Summary" for the "Failed tests" line.
   If "Failed tests" is not 0, the unit test failed.

3. Look at the Summary in the "Run" window.

   If "(failed on nodejs)" is not 0, you must fix the javascript code
   and rerun from step 1.


4. Look at the Summary in the "Run" window.

   If "(failed on diff)" is not 0, look above for "RESULT: diff test failed".
   a. Copy
        FROM: [STUB].out.json
          TO: [STUB].out.reference.json
      and TO: [STUB].out.reference.readable.json
   b. Open [STUB].out.reference.readable.json and click <CTRL-ALT-L> to format the text.
   c. Select [STUB].out.reference.readable.json the "Project" window and
      click the "Compare with Same Repository Version" icon to compare with
      the checked-in version.

      If the results are correct, then check in
                [STUB].out.reference.json
            and [STUB].out.reference.readable.json

      If the results are incorrect, fix the javascript code and rerun from step 1.
