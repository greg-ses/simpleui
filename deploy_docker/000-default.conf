	# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
	# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
	# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
	# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.

	# Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,

	# It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular

	#LogLevel info ssl:warn

	# The following directives define some format nicknames for use with
	# a CustomLog directive.
	#
	# These deviate from the Common Log Format definitions in that they use %O
	# (the actual bytes sent including headers) instead of %b (the size of the
	# requested file), because the latter makes it impossible to detect partial
	# requests.
	#
	# Note that the use of %{X-Forwarded-For}i instead of %h is not recommended.
	# Use mod_remoteip instead.
